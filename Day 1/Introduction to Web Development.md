### **Key Concepts** 🧩

#### 1. **Server** 🖥️
- A server is a system that provides resources, services, or data to other computers (clients) over a network.
- In web development, servers are responsible for hosting websites and handling requests from users.

#### 2. **Client** 💻
- A client is a device or program that requests resources or services from a server.
- Examples: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox) are clients that request web pages from servers.

#### 3. **Web Application** 🌐
- A web application is a dynamic, interactive program accessed through a web browser.
- Examples: E-commerce websites, social media platforms, and email services.
